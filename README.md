# Election Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the results of the 2024 elections using historical election data from 1978-2019. We leverage various machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models with TensorFlow and Keras, to achieve accurate predictions. An interactive web application built with Streamlit provides real-time election predictions and visualizations.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict the 2024 election results using historical data and advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Data:** Historical election data from 1999-2019.
- **Models Used:** Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Neural Networks (TensorFlow and Keras).

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis:** Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns in historical election data.
- **Model Training:** Utilized various algorithms to train classification models and validated their performance.
- **Web Application:** Interactive Streamlit app for real-time election predictions and visualizations.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Enhanced prediction accuracy through advanced data preprocessing and feature engineering.
